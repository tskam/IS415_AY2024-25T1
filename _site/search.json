    "text": "Grading Criteria\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\n\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readxl, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the entire geospatial data wrangling processes, including. This is not limited to data import, data extraction, data cleaning and data transformation. Besides assessing your ability to use the R functions, this criterion also includes your ability to clean and derive appropriate variables to meet the analysis need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAll data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them).\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analysis (30 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate spatial point patterns analysis methods and R packages introduced in class to analysis the geospatial data prepared. You will be assessed on your ability to derive analytical products by using appropriate kernel estimation techniques.\nGeovisualisation and geocommunication (20 marks): In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis and Confirmatory Spatial Data Analysis results in layman friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.\nReproducibility (15 marks): This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of Quarto. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.\nBonus (15 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data."

    "text": "Project Deliverables\n\nProject Website\n\nProject Github\nAt the beginning of the project, project teams are required to create a project Github. The project Github should include all the materials used to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal, poster and practice research paper. It must be used to maintain a complete project versioning including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\n\n\nProject Website\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using Quatro. It will be disseminated by using Netfity web service.\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the course wiki that includes:\n\nThe title of your project,\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build, and\nThe project proposal. This should in a webblog page (remember to provide a link at eLearn).\n\n\n\n\nPoster\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\n\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\n\nThe dimensions for the poster must conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO) poster size format (A1).\n\nSize = ISO A1 (594 × 841mm or 23.39 × 33.11inci)\nResolution = 300dpi or above\nFile format = jpeg\n\nPlease ensure that the poster is in high resolution.\nThe poster will be considered as a final deliverable. So don’t forget to apply good visual design principles to both your poster and project report.\nNote: The course instructor will be responsible for printing your poster. You are required to upload your poster onto the project Dropbox of eLearn according to the submission deadline provided on the project milesotne sub-section.\n\n\nPeer Evaluation\nThis component is not a typical peer evaluation of project. For Geospatial Analytics Project, students are required to evaluate at least three applications prepared by your coursemate during the townhall presentation session. A peer evaluation form will be provided. Each team only need to submit one report.\n\n\nFinal Deliverables\nThe final deliverable will include:\n\nupdated project webpage.\nartifact including the ShinyApp, data and all r modules.\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the Shiny Applications.\nproject poster"

A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\n\nGrading criteria for poster\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\n\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\nClear communication of design approaches\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\nCraft quality of the solution"

    "text": "Course Assessment Details\n\nPre-lesson Learning and Class Participation\nPre-lesson learning materials, namely: videos, slides, recommended readings and hands-on exercises will be released one week before the weekly lesson starts. A strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned pre-learning materials before coming to class. Students are required write down at least one question or issue encountered while viewing the video, reading the recommended articles or working on the hands-on exercises and post them on Piazza for discussion.\nStudent sharing of insights from readings of assigned materials on Piazza will form a large part of the learning in this course.\n\n\nHands-on Exercise (20%)\nHands-on exercises aim to provide students to gain hands-on experience on using selected R packages to perform geospatial analysis with real world use cases. It is important for students to complete the hands-on exercises before class.\n\n\nIn-class Exercise (20%)\nIn-class exercise and discussion will extend the methods learned from the hands-on exercise to advanced modelling. The in-class discussion will also focus on how to interpret the analysis results and to communicate the analysis results by using appropriate map and data visualisation techniques. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to in-class exercise.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise (30%)\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real-world cases. Each take-home exercise is an extension of the hands-on and in-class exercises. What this means is that, for example, in Lesson 1, students will learn the concept of spatial point processes and the hands-on exercise will provide students step-by-step guide on how to use R packages to perform spatial point patterns analysis. The in-class discussion, beside clarification of the concepts and usage of R packages syntax and argument, it will focus more on how to interpret and communicate the analysis results. Then the take-home exercise will require students to synthesise what they have learned from the readings, hands-on exercise and in-class exercise. The estimated workload will be about 6-8 hours per week.\nEach take-home exercise will carry a same weightage of 10%. The deliverable format of the take-home exercises and marking rubric of will be provided on the handout of the take-home exercise. Feedback on take-home exercise will be provided weekly before the weekly lesson starts. This is to ensure that students will learn from mistakes made in the earlier take-home exercise and improve their work progressively in the subsequent take-home exercises.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s.\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Project (30%)\nThe purpose of the geospatial analytics project is to provide students first hand experience on building web-based geospatial analytics tool by integrating open source web mapping API(s), data visualisation API(s) and geospatial analysis libraries. You will also learn how to collecting, processing and analysing spatially related issues using real world data. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThere will be no final examination for this course."

For example, the proportional maps above use circle with different sizes to represent millions of people. There are two types of point features that are typically depicted with proportional symbols: features for which the data represents a geographic position directly (e.g., gallons of oil from individual oil wells), and features that are geographic areas to which data are aggregated and the data magnitudes are assigned to a representative point within the area (e.g., the geographic centroid of a state as in the examples above). In either case, the area of the symbol is scaled to represent the data magnitude, sometimes with a bit of exaggeration to adjust for a general tendency of human vision to underestimate differences in area. A variant on this direct data-to-symbol scaling groups values into categories first, then scales the symbol to represent the mean for the category, assigning a symbol to each place to represent the category range that the mean for the place falls within"

Yet, illicit drug consumption remains highly prevalent and continues to be a growing problem worldwide. In 2021, 1 in 17 people aged 15–64 in the world had used a drug in the past 12 months. Notwithstanding population growth, the estimated number of drug users grew from 240 million in 2011 to 296 million in 2021.\nThe geopolitics of Thailand which is near the Golden Triangle of Indochina, the largest drug production site in Asia, and the constant transportation infrastructure development made Thailand became market and transit routes for drug trafficking to the third countries.\nIn Thailand, drug abuse is one of the major social issue. There are about 2.7 million youths using drugs in Thailand. Among youths aged between 15 and 19 years, there are about 300,000 who have needs for drug treatment. Most of Thai youths involved with drugs are vocational-school students, which nearly doubles in number compared to secondary-school students.\nFigure below shows geographic distribution of drug use cases by province and by year."

    "text": "Grading Criteria\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\n\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability:\n\nto employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readxl, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the import and extract the data.\nto clean and derive appropriate variables for meeting the analysis need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAll data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them.\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analysis (30 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation to perform the analysis. You will be assessed on your ability:\n\nto describe the methods used correctly, and\nto provide accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\n\nGeovisualisation and geocommunication (20 marks): In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.\nReproducibility (15 marks): This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of Quarto. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.\nBonus (15 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data."
