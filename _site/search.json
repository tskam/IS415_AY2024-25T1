Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll acts of academic dishonesty (including, but not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, facilitation of acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of exam questions, or tampering with the academic work of other students) are serious offences.

Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on real-world applications of geospatial analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to class participation.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real world cases.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\nAY2021-22 Sample Take-home Exercises\n\nTake-home Exercise 1\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the Geospatial Analytics Project is to provide students first-hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing spatial data using real world data. A project may involve creating geospatially enabled business data and subsequently analysing these data for business strategic or market analysis. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools or models within a web framework. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 3 members by the third week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas between week 4 and week 7. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor during the weeks too. A project website will be prepared and submitted to the instructor for approval by the end of week 8.\nAll project teams will give a postal presentation outlining the database design and implementation process, analytical methods used and findings of their project in week 14. Students are also required to prepare a project report or research paper of not more than 15 pages (excluding maps, figures, and tables) for submission by week 14. Additional materials will be distributed in class to assist students with topics selection, project design, postal presentation, and project report."

The project Github should include all the materials used to develop the project and the written materials such as proposal, poster and practice research paper. It must be used to maintain a complete project versioning including the application and project documents. The Github link must be included in the project proposal. By the end of the project, the project team must pack the final version of the Github repository and upload onto eLearn for final submission. The Github link also must be provided on eLearn.\n\n\nProject Website\nEach project team are required to create the project website by using Quatro. It will be disseminated by using Netfity web service.\nAs a first step, you should create a project summary at the course wiki that includes:\n\nThe title of your project,\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build, and\nThe project proposal. This should in a webblog page (remember to provide a link at eLearn).\n\n\n\n\nPoster\nThe project poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information:\n\nIssues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses.\nMotivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve.\nApproach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.\nResults - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.\nFuture Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\n\nThe dimensions for the poster must conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO) poster size format (A1).\n\nSize = ISO A1 (594 × 841mm or 23.39 × 33.11inci)\nResolution = 300dpi or above\nFile format = jpeg\n\nPlease ensure that the poster is in high resolution.\nThe poster will be considered as a final deliverable. So don’t forget to apply good visual design principles to both your poster and project report.\nNote: The course instructor will be responsible for printing your poster. You are required to upload your poster onto the project Dropbox of eLearn according to the submission deadline provided on the project milesotne sub-section.\n\n\nPeer Evaluation\nThis component is not a typical peer evaluation of project. For Geospatial Analytics Project, students are required to evaluate at least three applications prepared by your coursemate during the townhall presentation session. A peer evaluation form will be provided. Each team only need to submit one report.\n\n\nFinal Deliverables\nThe final deliverable will include:\n\nupdated project webpage.\nartifact including the ShinyApp, data and all r modules.\nUser Guide - Step-by-step guide on how to use the Shiny Applications.\nproject poster"

The distribution of marks for each stage of the project are as follows:\n\nProject website 25%\nPoster 10%\nPeer Evaluation 15%\nShinyApp 50%\n\nThe course instructor will consider strongly the novelty of the idea (If it has never been done before, you will get lots of credit!), how it addresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the research, and your technical skill in implementing the idea.\nIn small group projects, each person will be graded individually. A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\n\nGrading criteria for poster\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\n\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\nClear communication of design approaches\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\nCraft quality of the solution"
