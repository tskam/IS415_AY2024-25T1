    "text": "Course Assessment Details\n\nPre-lesson Learning and Class Participation\nPre-lesson learning materials, namely: videos, slides, recommended readings and hands-on exercises will be released one week before the weekly lesson starts. A strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned pre-learning materials before coming to class. Students are required write down at least one question or issue encountered while viewing the video, reading the recommended articles or working on the hands-on exercises and post them on Piazza for discussion.\nStudent sharing of insights from readings of assigned materials on Piazza will form a large part of the learning in this course.\n\n\nHands-on Exercise (20%)\nHands-on exercises aim to provide students to gain hands-on experience on using selected R packages to perform geospatial analysis with real world use cases. It is important for students to complete the hands-on exercises before class.\n\n\nIn-class Exercise (20%)\nIn-class exercise and discussion will extend the methods learned from the hands-on exercise to advanced modelling. The in-class discussion will also focus on how to interpret the analysis results and to communicate the analysis results by using appropriate map and data visualisation techniques. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to in-class exercise.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise (30%)\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real-world cases. Each take-home exercise is an extension of the hands-on and in-class exercises. What this means is that, for example, in Lesson 1, students will learn the concept of spatial point processes and the hands-on exercise will provide students step-by-step guide on how to use R packages to perform spatial point patterns analysis. The in-class discussion, beside clarification of the concepts and usage of R packages syntax and argument, it will focus more on how to interpret and communicate the analysis results. Then the take-home exercise will require students to synthesise what they have learned from the readings, hands-on exercise and in-class exercise. The estimated workload will be about 6-8 hours per week.\nEach take-home exercise will carry a same weightage of 10%. The deliverable format of the take-home exercises and marking rubric of will be provided on the handout of the take-home exercise. Feedback on take-home exercise will be provided weekly before the weekly lesson starts. This is to ensure that students will learn from mistakes made in the earlier take-home exercise and improve their work progressively in the subsequent take-home exercises.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s.\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Project (30%)\nThe purpose of the geospatial analytics project is to provide students first hand experience on building web-based geospatial analytics tool by integrating open source web mapping API(s), data visualisation API(s) and geospatial analysis libraries. You will also learn how to collecting, processing and analysing spatially related issues using real world data. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThere will be no final examination for this course."

A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\n\nGrading criteria for poster\nThe poster will be graded based on the following criteria:\n\nClear communication of key aspects of solution\nClear communication of design approaches\nClear communication of arguments for proposed solution\nCraft quality of the solution"

Then you create rows with fluidRow(), and columns with column().\n\nfluidPage(\n  fluidRow(\n    column(4, \n      ...\n    ),\n    column(8, \n      ...\n    )\n  ),\n  fluidRow(\n    column(6, \n      ...\n    ),\n    column(6, \n      ...\n    )\n  )\n)"

They both take an id argument and use it to namespace the module. To create a module, we need to extract code out of the app UI and server and put it in to the module UI and server.\n\n\n\nIn-class Exercise: Building Shiny App with Basic Modele\nIn order to understand the basics of Shiny modules, let us consider a simple Shiny application codes to plot a histogram shown below.\n\n\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  selectInput(\"var\", \n              \"Variable\", \n              names(mtcars)),\n  numericInput(\"bins\", \n               \"bins\", \n               10, \n               min = 1),\n  plotOutput(\"hist\")\n)\nserver &lt;- function(input, \n                   output, \n                   session) {\n  data &lt;- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])\n  output$hist &lt;- renderPlot({\n    hist(data(), \n         breaks = input$bins, \n         main = input$var)\n  }, res = 96)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule UI\nWe’ll start with the module UI. There are two steps:\n\nPut the UI code inside a function that has an id argument.\nWrap each existing ID in a call to NS(), so that (e.g.) “var” turns into NS(id, “var”).\n\n\nhistogramUI &lt;- function(id) {\n  tagList(\n    selectInput(NS(id, \"var\"), \"Variable\", choices = names(mtcars)),\n    numericInput(NS(id, \"bins\"), \"bins\", value = 10, min = 1),\n    plotOutput(NS(id, \"hist\"))\n  )\n}\n\n\nHere we have returned the UI components in a tagList(), which is a special type of layout function that allows you to bundle together multiple components without actually implying how they will be laid out.\nIt is the responsibility of the person calling histogramUI() to wrap the result in a layout function like column() or fluidRow() according to their needs.\n\n\n\n\nModule server\nNext we tackle the server function. This gets wrapped inside another function which must have an id argument. This function calls moduleServer() with the id, and a function that looks like a regular server function:\n\nhistogramServer &lt;- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    data &lt;- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])\n    output$hist &lt;- renderPlot({\n      hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)\n    }, res = 96)\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nmoduleServer() takes care of the namespacing automatically: inside of moduleServer(id),\ninput\\(var* and *input\\)bins refer to the inputs with names NS(id, “var”) and NS(id, “bins”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised Shiny Application\nNow that we have the ui and server functions, it’s good practice to write a function that uses them to generate an app which we can use for experimentation and testing:\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n    histogramUI(\"hist\")\n    )\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n    histogramServer(\"hist\")\n    }\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLike all Shiny control, you need to use the same id in both UI and server, otherwise the two pieces will not be connected.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class Exercise: Function to import csv file\n\n\n\n\nModule UI function\n\n# Module UI function\ncsvFileUI &lt;- function(id, label = \"CSV file\") {\n    # `NS(id)` returns a namespace function, which was save as `ns` and will\n    # invoke later.\n    ns &lt;- NS(id)\n    \n    tagList(\n        fileInput(ns(\"file\"), label),\n        checkboxInput(ns(\"heading\"), \"Has heading\"),\n        selectInput(ns(\"quote\"), \"Quote\", c(\n            \"None\" = \"\",\n            \"Double quote\" = \"\\\"\",\n            \"Single quote\" = \"'\"\n        ))\n    )\n}\n\n\n\n\nModule server function\n\ncsvFileServer &lt;- function(id, stringsAsFactors) {\n    moduleServer(\n        id,\n        function(input, output, session) {\n            userFile &lt;- reactive({\n                validate(need(input$file, message = FALSE))\n                input$file\n            })\n            dataframe &lt;- reactive({\n                read.csv(userFile()$datapath,\n                         header = input$heading,\n                         quote = input$quote,\n                         stringsAsFactors = stringsAsFactors)\n            })\n            observe({\n                msg &lt;- sprintf(\"File %s was uploaded\", userFile()$name)\n                cat(msg, \"\\n\")\n            })\n            return(dataframe)\n        }\n    )    \n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Shiny app\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            csvFileUI(\"datafile\", \"User data (.csv format)\")\n        ),\n        mainPanel(\n            dataTableOutput(\"table\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n    datafile &lt;- csvFileServer(\"datafile\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n    \n    output$table &lt;- renderDataTable({\n        datafile()\n    })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)"

This is the easiest case, because you’ll get a traceback which allows you to figure out exactly where the error occurred.\nYou don’t get any errors, but some value is incorrect. Here, you’ll need to use the interactive debugger, along with your investigative skills to track down the root cause.\nAll the values are correct, but they’re not updated when you expect. This is the most challenging problem because it’s unique to Shiny, so you can’t take advantage of your existing R debugging skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon errors\n\n“Object of type ‘closure’ is not subsettable”\n\nYou forgot to use () when retrieving a value from a reactive expression plot(userData) should be plot(userData())\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon errors\n\n“Unexpected symbol\n\n\n“Argument xxx is missing, with no default”\n\nMissing or extra comma in UI.\nSometimes Shiny will realise this and give you a hint, or use RStudio editor margin diagnostics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon errors\n\n“Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)\n\nTried to access an input or reactive expression from directly inside the server function. You must use a reactive expression or observer instead.\nOr if you really only care about the value of that input at the time that the session starts, then use isolate()."

The next few functions are internal, and you can ignore them.\n\nFinally, at the very top, you’ll see the code that you have written:\n\nThis is the code called inside of renderPlot(). You can tell you should pay attention here because of the file path and line number; this lets you know that it’s your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you get an error in your app but don’t see a traceback then make sure that you’re running the app using Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter (or if not in RStudio, calling runApp()), and that you’ve saved the file that you’re running it from. Other ways of running the app don’t always capture the information necessary to make a traceback."

Each time the user changes their input selection, the expression that generates the output will automatically re-execute, and the relevant output will be re-rendered based on the new value of the input.\nIn a Shiny application, there’s no need to explictly describe the relationships between inputs and outputs and tell R what to do when each input changes, Shiny automatically handles these details for you.\n\n\nSource: Module 2 of Building Web Applications with Shiny\n\n\n\n\nReactive Flow - The full features\n\n\n\n\nReactive elements\n\n\nThree components of reactive execution in Shiny are:\n\nreactive inputs,\nreactive expressions, and\nreactive outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactive elements\n\n\n\n\nReactive inputs and outputs\n\nA reactive input is a user input that comes through a browser interface, typically.\nA reactive output is something that appears in the user’s browser window, such as a plot or a table of values.\n\n\n\nOne reactive input can be connected to multiple outputs, and vice versa. For example we might have a UI input widget for filtering out data based on user’s selection, and the filtered data can be used in multiple outputs like plots and summaries.\n\n\n\n\nReactive expressions\n\nA reactive expressions is component between an input and an output.\nIt can both be a dependent (i.e be a child) and have dependents (i.e. be a parent)."
