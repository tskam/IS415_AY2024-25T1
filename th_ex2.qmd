This handout provides the context, the task, the expectation and the grading criteria of Take-home Exercise 2. Students must review and understand them before getting started with the take-home exercise.

## Setting the Scene

Drug abuse is associated with significant negative health, financial and social consequences. Yet, illicit drug consumption remains highly prevalent and continues to be a growing problem worldwide. In 2021, 1 in 17 people aged 15–64 in the world had used a drug in the past 12 months. Notwithstanding population growth, the estimated number of drug users grew from 240 million in 2011 to 296 million in 2021.

The geopolitics of Thailand which is near the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)) of Indochina, the largest drug production site in Asia, and the constant transportation infrastructure development made Thailand became market and transit routes for drug trafficking to the third countries.

In Thailand, drug abuse is one of the major social issue. There are about 2.7 million youths using drugs in Thailand. Among youths aged between 15 and 19 years, there are about 300,000 who have needs for drug treatment. Most of Thai youths involved with drugs are vocational-school students, which nearly doubles in number compared to secondary-school students.

Figure below shows geographic distribution of drug use cases by province and by year.

## Objectives

As a curious geospatial analytics green horn, you are interested to discover:

-   if the key indicators of drug abuse of Thailand are independent from space.
-   If the indicators of drug abuse is indeed spatial dependent, then, you would like to detect where are the clusters and outliers, and the hotspots.
-   Last but not least, you are also interested to investigate how the observation above evolve over time.

## The Task

The specific tasks of this take-home exercise are as follows:

-   Using appropriate function of **sf** and **tidyverse**, preparing the following geospatial data layer:
    -   a study area layer in sf polygon features. It must be at [province level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand) (including Bangkok) of Thailand.
    -   a drug abuse indicators layer within the study area in sf polygon features.
-   Using the extracted data, perform global spatial autocorrelation analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex05/in-class_ex05-glsa).
-   Using the extracted data, perform local spatial autocorrelation analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/chap10.html).
-   Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the analysis above.

::: {.callout-note}
A quality research should go beyond pre-defined scope of work.  Students are encouraged to extend your investigate by using the suggested.  You are also encouraged to explore appropriate method(s) not mentioned above.

## The Data

For the purpose of this take-home exercise, two data sets shall be used, they are:

-   [Thailand Drug Offenses [2017-2022]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-drug-offenses-2017-2022) at Kaggle.

-   [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) at HDX. You are required to use the province boundary data set.

## Grading Criteria

This exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:

-   **Geospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks):** This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability:

    -   to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readxl, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the import and extract the data.
    -   to clean and derive appropriate variables for meeting the analysis need.

::: callout-warning
All data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them.
:::

-   **Geospatial Analysis (30 marks):** In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation to perform the analysis. You will be assessed on your ability:

    -   to describe the methods used correctly, and
    -   to provide accurate interpretation of the analysis results.

-   **Geovisualisation and geocommunication (20 marks):** In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.

-   **Reproducibility (15 marks):** This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of Quarto. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.

-   **Bonus (15 marks):** Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data.

## Submission Instructions

-   The write-up of the take-home exercise must be in **Quarto html document** format. You are required to publish the write-up on [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).
-   Zip the take-home exercise folder and upload it onto eLearn. If the size of the zip file is beyond the capacity of eLearn, you can upload it on SMU OneDrive and provide the download link on eLearn..

## Due Date

6th October 2024 (Sunday), 11.59pm (midnight).

## Learning from senior

You are advised to review these sample submissions prepared by your seniors.

-   [KHANT MIN NAING](https://is415-geospatial-with-khant.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex02/take-home_ex02): Very well done in all the five grading criteria especially the ability to provide a comprehensive overview of the analysis methods used and discussion on the analysis results.
-   [MATTHEW HO YIWEN](https://is415-gaa-matthew-ho.netlify.app/takehomeex/takehomeex2/the2) Able to provide a clear and comprehensive discussion on the geospatial data wrangling process and to communicate the analysis results by using appropriate geovisualisation and data visualisation methods.

## Q & A

Please submit your questions or queries related to this take-home exercise on Piazza.
