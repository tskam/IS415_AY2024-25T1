## What is a Spatio-Temporal Point Process

A spatio-temporal point process (also called space-time or spatial-temporal point process) is a random collection of points, where each point represents the time and location of an event. Examples of events include incidence of disease, sightings or births of a species, or the occurrences of fires, earthquakes, lightning strikes, tsunamis, or volcanic eruptions. Typically the spatio-temporal point events are recorded in three-dimension, namely: longitude, latitude, and time as shown in the figure below.
